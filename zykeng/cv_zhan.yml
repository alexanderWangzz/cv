      - But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.
      - But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
      - Can you then suppose that those heroic men performed their famous deeds without any motive at all?
